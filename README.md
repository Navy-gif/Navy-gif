### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Engineering student from Finland.  
I work on things here and there, mainly discord bots and miscellaneous projects.  

I can work with Python, JS (Node & React among others), Java, C#, Lua, C and C++. Probably forgot some... Point being I'm flexible.  
Most familiar with JS technologies, such as Express & React.  

Many of the projects I work on are in private repositories for various reasons, though feel free to browse my old projects if you feel like reading through poorly designed and crappy code.  

Many of them are also on my own [gitea](https://git.corgi.wtf) instance.
