### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Engineering student from Finland.  
I work on things here and there, mainly discord bots and miscellaneous projects.  

I can work with Python, JS (Node & React among others), Java, C# & Lua.  
I also have a primitive understanding of C and C++.  

Many of the projects I work on are in private repositories for various reasons, though feel free to browse my old projects if you feel like reading through poorly designed and crappy code.
