### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Engineer from Finland.  
I work on various projects, mostly in TypeScript and occasionally C++ today.

I can work with Python, JS/TS (Node & React among others), Java, C#, Lua, C and C++. Probably forgot some... Point being I'm flexible.  
Most familiar with JS technologies, such as Express & React.  

Many of the projects I work on are in private repositories for various reasons, though feel free to browse my old projects if you feel like reading through poorly designed and crappy code.  

Many of them are also on my own [gitea](https://git.corgi.wtf) instance.
